yk that feeling when you type it in notepad and it's maayos then when you paste it to vscode it's not aligned at all...


1. All types of syntax errors and lexical errors are handled by the interpreter system. The error messages are sufficient to debug the errors.

2. Variables of the basic data types (Boolean, int, string, float) are supported in the system. Variables are allocated and bound properly to a name and "address (in the symbol table)" .

3. Operations and assignment statements check data types properly. The interpreter system throws appropriate semantic errors when unsupported operations are encountered. Coercion is properly handled or implemented.

4. Variables are only available in their appropriate scopes. Scoping (static or dynamic) works properly/as intended.

5. The interpreter can execute all types of arithmetic expressions properly. Precedence and associativity are well-respected, as well as any potential coercion.

6. The interpreter can evaluate all types of Boolean/relational expressions. Precedence is well-respected, as well as any potential coercion.

7. Type and value binding is properly updated upon execution of all types of assignment statements. If supported, mixed-mode assignment is properly implemented.

8. The interpreter is sufficiently able to handle branching logic. The language is able to handle complex decision tree structures (regardless of readability/writability).

9. The interpreter is able to handle iterative logic. The language is able to handle all necessary loop variants (count-controlled, logic-controlled, user-controlled; disregard types excluded as a language design decision).

10. The language can sufficiently interact with the user by receiving input from the terminal/console/standard input/an input file and by printing strings to the terminal/console/standard output/an output file.

11. The language supports the declaration of subroutines. Control is properly passed between subroutines during runtime. Recursive functions work properly in the context of the language.

12. Any special abstract data types/collection types will be graded here. (Eg, collection data types, OOP, etc)

13. Code blocks/control structures/subroutines can throw exceptions, and the language has mechanisms to handle these exceptions.

14. Any additional features.
